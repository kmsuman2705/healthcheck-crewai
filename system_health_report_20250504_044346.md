## System Health Report - 2025-05-04 04:43:46

**Overall Assessment:** The system currently exhibits several potential concerns. Elevated CPU and memory usage require immediate attention.

**Metric Analysis:**

*   **CPU Usage (%):** 2.0% - **WARNING: Exceeds the acceptable threshold of 85%.**  This suggests potential CPU exhaustion and may impact overall system responsiveness.
*   **Memory Used (GB):** 1.41 - **WARNING: Exceeds the acceptable threshold of 85%.**  This indicates potential memory pressure, which could lead to application crashes or performance degradation.
*   **Memory Total (GB):** 7.64 - **WARNING: Exceeds the acceptable threshold of 85%.**  This shows significant memory usage, potentially requiring optimization or increased RAM allocation.
*   **Memory Usage (%):** 22.1% - **WARNING: Exceeds the acceptable threshold of 85%.**  This indicates a high degree of memory consumption, potentially impacting performance and causing stability issues.
*   **Disk Used (GB):** 7.93 - **WARNING: Exceeds the acceptable threshold of 85%.**  This suggests disk I/O saturation, which can lead to slower performance.
*   **Disk Total (GB):** 47.39 - **WARNING: Exceeds the acceptable threshold of 85%.**  This indicates potential storage capacity limitations.
*   **Disk Usage (%):** 16.7% - **WARNING: Exceeds the acceptable threshold of 85%.**  This suggests a relatively high disk utilization, which may be contributing to the overall system performance issues.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Investigate CPU Usage:** Immediately identify the processes consuming the most CPU.  Use system monitoring tools to pinpoint the source of the high utilization.
2.  **Analyze Memory Usage:**  Check for memory leaks, inefficient data handling, or excessive memory allocation. Consider increasing RAM allocation if necessary.
3.  **Monitor Disk Usage:**  Identify and address any disk I/O bottlenecks.  Consider optimizing file access patterns or upgrading storage hardware.
4.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring of these metrics to proactively identify and address any further issues before they impact system stability.

**Next Steps:**  Schedule a deeper dive into the root cause of the high CPU and memory usage to prevent future issues.

## System Health Report - 2025-05-04 08:34:36

**Overall Assessment:** The system is currently exhibiting concerning resource utilization. Several metrics are exceeding defined thresholds, demanding immediate investigation and potential optimization.

**Metric Breakdown:**

*   **CPU Usage (%):** 2.0% - **Warning: Exceeds 85% threshold.** This indicates potential CPU bottlenecking. Further investigation is required to determine the root cause.
*   **Memory Used (GB):** 1.53 - **Warning: Exceeds 85% threshold.**  Memory usage is elevated, suggesting potential memory pressure or inefficient processes.
*   **Memory Total (GB):** 7.64 - **Warning: Exceeds 85% threshold.** Memory allocation is at a high level.
*   **Memory Usage (%):** 24.1% - **Warning: Exceeds 85% threshold.**  High memory utilization significantly impacts performance.
*   **Disk Used (GB):** 8.16 - **Warning: Exceeds 85% threshold.** Disk space is reaching capacity, contributing to performance issues.
*   **Disk Total (GB):** 47.39 - **Warning: Exceeds 85% threshold.** Disk space is nearing capacity.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **CPU Investigation:** Analyze CPU usage patterns to pinpoint the source of the 2.0% increase.  Consider background processes, CPU-intensive tasks, or potential hardware limitations.
2.  **Memory Optimization:**  Review memory allocation strategies. Identify memory leaks or inefficient processes consuming excessive memory. Consider increasing RAM or optimizing memory usage within applications.
3.  **Disk Space Monitoring:** Implement disk space monitoring to proactively identify and address potential capacity issues. Schedule regular disk optimization routines.
4.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a thorough root cause analysis to determine if these high utilization rates are a transient issue or indicate a persistent problem.
5.  **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor these metrics to ensure the system remains within acceptable limits.

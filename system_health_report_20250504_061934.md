## System Health Report - 2025-05-04 06:19:34

**Overall Assessment:** The system is currently under moderate risk. While CPU usage is exceptionally low, the Memory Used (2.76GB) and Memory Usage (40.2%) metrics indicate potential pressure.

**Metric Breakdown:**

*   **CPU Usage (%):** 0.0% -  Exceptionally low, indicating no significant resource contention.
*   **Memory Used (GB):** 2.76GB - Slightly above 85% threshold.
*   **Memory Total (GB):** 7.64GB - Near the threshold.
*   **Memory Usage (%):** 40.2% - Relatively high, suggesting potential memory pressure.
*   **Disk Used (GB):** 12.52GB - Normal.
*   **Disk Total (GB):** 47.39GB - Normal.
*   **Disk Usage (%):** 26.4% - Within acceptable limits.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Investigate Memory Pressure:** The high Memory Usage (40.2%) and the slightly elevated CPU usage (0.0%) warrant closer monitoring. A deeper investigation into memory leaks or inefficient memory utilization is recommended.

2.  **Monitor Memory Consumption:**  Continuously track Memory Usage (40.2%) to identify any sudden increases or patterns.

3.  **CPU Utilization Trend:**  Observe the CPU Usage (%) over time to establish a baseline and detect any unusual spikes or drops.

4.  **Disk Space Utilization:**  Monitor Disk Usage (%) to ensure sufficient free space is available without causing performance degradation.  A potential bottleneck could be storage issues.

5.  **Further Analysis:** Perform a more detailed analysis to determine if these values represent a genuine issue or a temporary fluctuation.
